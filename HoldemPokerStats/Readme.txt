// What we want to do now.

// Add ability to take each starting hand type and test its effectiveness against every other starting hand

// At each stage of the hand we want to figure out when we got our best hand and if we lose it when and to what.
// This will give us a good indication on how we should bet the hands we have based on how likely we are to lose them
// if there are still cards to come.

// We want to cover how often you will see the hand
// How often it will win
//	When you win, what will you win over, give you an idea of what you can bet and get called on.
// How often it will split
// How often it will lose
//	When it loses, what will it lose too

// Eventually we need stats on what you have, chances of it improving to a better hand.
// given what the board has what is the chance other people have other hands, what is their chance of improving.

// Suited verses non suited

// Run the simulation of each hand against x amount of other hands
// for each starting hand determine its status on the flop, turn, river
// Determine what the winning hand is, pre-fop, flop, turn, river
// Determine for each hand percent of domination.
